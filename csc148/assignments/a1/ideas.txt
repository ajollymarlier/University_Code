- Simulation runs on a round basis and elevators can move up or down one every round

People
    - Person contains started_floor, destination_floor, and number of rounds waiting
    - Person's wait time increases when they're waiting on a floor and when they're in an elevator

Elevators
    - Elevators can move up or down one every round
    - They have a capacity and cannot board new people when the capacity is met

People Generation
    - Placement of people can be randomly generated on startup from a fixed amount
    - Their starting and target floor are all all random, but starting and target floor cannot be the same
    - People can also be generated from data in a csv file
    - Each line of the file represents all the arrivals for a certain round number
    - After the first number which signifies the round in which the rest of the line occurs,
      their is an even number of entries with the first number in the pair is the starting floor,
      and the second is the target floor

    1, 1, 4, 5, 3

    Description:
    - Round 1: one person whose starting floor is 1 and target floor is 4, and
      another person whose starting floor is 5 and target floor is 3, in that order
